# nco_bus_service
Bus srevice for Noaptea Companiilor - a demo app, built everything from scratch.

A simple database-managing app for companies registered for the Noaptea Companiilor event and the buslines deserving these companies plus the UI pert of viewing the companies on a map and simulating the movement of the bus by clicking the "Move Bus" button.
I chose not to embed google maps, but instead of using a non-scalable, chessboard style map so that I could implement some JavaScript interactivity for selecting the companies' locations, highlighting them on map, etc.
Of course, there is room for lots of improvements, there are a few bugs, there's no security implementation, no exception handling, etc. I might revisit sometimes to fix these issues.

Here's a demo video, showing how it works:
